This is a repository of sample workers to be used on [IronWorker](http://www.iron.io).

Feel free to copy, steal, take credit for, or whatever you feel like doing with this code. ;)

## Getting Started

You can run all of these examples by creating an `.iron.json` config file in your home directory.

It should look like this:

```
{
	"token": "YOUR TOKEN",
	"project_id": "YOUR PROJECT ID"
}
```

You can get your token from: https://hud.iron.io/tokens . **Be sure to keep your token private!**

You can get your project_id from your project list in https://hud.iron.io/tq/projects

For full details on configuration, see [Configuration article](http://dev.iron.io/articles/configuration/) in [Dev Center](http://dev.iron.io/).

## Now Run the Examples and Learn from Them

See the README's in each of the examples directories to run and review the code to learn how it works.

Try the HelloWorker examples in the language of your choice if it's your first time.
